Notes.

For this exercise I used the jre1.8.0_181 with 
Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers.
Version: Neon.3 Release (4.6.3)
Build id: 20170314-1500

Included are the following files:

a. Example.java

That program takes user input and processes those options via 6 case statements.
There are 5 different methods:

readInstructions
readSampleInput
readSampleOutput
runTreasureHunt
addToFile

b. TreasureHunt.java

Three text files used for input and output.
They are: 

c. SampleInput.txt, d. SampleOutput.txt, and e. TreasureHunt.txt

The latter file basically entails the instructions as supplied

Those 3 files are accessed by placing them in a directory on my system of:

X:\text\ .  .. ... 

f.  One excecutable jar file named as: TreasureHunt.jar

I can be run as: java -jar TreasureHunt.jar
